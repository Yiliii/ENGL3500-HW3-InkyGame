Reflection: \
The fundamental debate between Ian Bogost and Miguel Sicart centers around the role of rules and systems in meaning-making. Bogost’s concept of procedural rhetoric suggests that games communicate meaning through their embedded rules and mechanics—players experience the game as designed, and their choices are limited by the system’s constraints​
. Sicart, on the other hand, critiques proceduralism for undervaluing the creative agency of players, arguing that play is not just about following rules but about making meaning beyond what the designer has planned​. \
Inky, as an interactive fiction tool, demonstrates the structured logic that aligns with Bogost’s view. While it allows players to choose between multiple paths, these paths are predefined and limited to the designer’s intentions. The player never truly alters the narrative’s foundation, and they can only traverse the space the designer has carved out for them. I found it interetsing to think about the analogy between the OR logic gate and the inky choices and diverts. The OR logic gate operates by taking multiple inputs and producing an output if at least one of the conditions is met. This structure mirrors the branching choices in an Inky narrative, where the story progresses based on predefined options available to the player. Much like how an OR gate allows current to flow along one of several possible paths depending on which inputs are active, an Inky story unfolds along different narrative branches depending on player decisions. However, just as an OR gate ultimately leads to a deterministic output based on its logic, an Inky narrative is constrained by the pathways the designer has written. The knots and diverts in Inky serve as decision points akin to circuit nodes, where the story's flow is funneled into structured pathways rather than allowing for unrestricted player agency. While the player may feel a sense of choice, the underlying system ensures that all possible outcomes are accounted for within the predesigned narrative architecture. \

During Wednesday’s lecture, sandbox games like Minecraft and multiplayer first-person shooters were discussed as counterpoints to proceduralism. These games appear to align with Sicart’s argument, as they prove the players' freedom to shape their experiences. In Minecraft, for example, players can construct elaborate architectures, focus on survival, or pursue achievements, seemingly making them co-designers of their own play experience. Similarly, in multiplayer shooters, players determine who lives or dies, who wins or loses, and may even engage in emergent behaviors such as "illegal teamwork" that break intended game mechanics. \

However, even these seemingly open-ended games operate under the overarching control of their designers, reinforcing Bogost’s argument. In Minecraft, despite the wide range of choices available, the game still has an ultimate goal—defeating the Ender Dragon. This endpoint, set by the game’s designers, functions as inevitable if a player seeks to "finish" the game. The presence of this fixed objective means that while players can explore many middle branches, they remain within a broader structure predefined by the developers. Similarly, in multiplayer shooters, the victory condition is always dictated by the system: regardless of how players manipulate the game, the match always ends with a designated winner. Even "illegal" strategies such as teaming up in a free-for-all setting exist only because the game’s creators have not explicitly prohibited them; should developers choose, they could patch the game or enforce bans, thereby reasserting their control. This reinforces the idea that, despite the illusion of boundless agency, the game’s structure ultimately dictates the boundaries of play.\

Thus, even in games that grant players significant creative freedom, the core experience remains shaped by the designer’s intent. Games ultimately convey meaning through the rules and constraints embedded in their design. The flexibility of sandbox and multiplayer experiences may extend the space of possible actions, but the fundamental structure remains an authored system where player agency exists only within predefined constraints.
